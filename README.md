news.theuse.net Reports
=======================

This is a set of reports that I run on the news.theuse.net news server.
If you are interested in the scripts themselves, see my [github
page](https://github.com/tgeek77/Usenet_Scripts).

Disclaimer:\
I haven\'t been running this server for very long so expect my numbers
to be quite low. However, if you are interested purely in which
newsgroups and hirearchies are seeing the most activity and by what
amount, then these reports should be useful to you.\
I am also in the process of recording this data into a spreadsheet and I
will share graphs of group growth around the first of every month.\
